        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
          JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
            and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
          </p>

          <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>

        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
          which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
          JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
          Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
          The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
          JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
          Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>

        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
          subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
          and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
          You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
          Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>

        <code>var x = 5; <br>
          var y = 6; <br>
          var z = x + y;</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>

        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
          The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:
          it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables.
          If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

          <code>const PI = 3.141592653589793; <br>
            PI = 3.14; // This will give an error <br>
            PI = PI + 10; // This will also give an error</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>

        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Boolean: true and false.</li>
          <li>null: a special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
          <li>undefined: a top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
          <li>Number: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
          <li>String: "Hello World!".</li>
          <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015): a data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          <li>Object: <code>const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
          Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
          You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

          <code>let length = 16; // Number <br>
            let lastName = "Johnson"; // String <br>
            let x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; // Object</code>
